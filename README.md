      <div align="center"><strong>Parse images from any website.</strong></div><br/><br/>
      While it may not be 100% reliable (thatâ€™s what standard extensions are for!), it can come in handy when dealing with blog posts or websites that arenâ€™t focused on manga but still have that one post you want to read inside your app.
    </td>
    <td>
      <div align="center"><strong>Open local PDFs</strong></div><br/><br/>
      Open PDFs without needing to convert them to ZIP/CBZ by storing them in the <code>/localpdf</code> directory. Then use it similarly to the "Local source".
